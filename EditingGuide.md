## Principles of Writing

We aim to be a small memorial rather than a wiki.
Therefore, we encourage you to write to mourn those transgender friends or allies who have passed away,
and to soothe those who are still alive.
We want to show our readers: “They were the same as me. They are one among us.”, no matter which gender identity they had.
Therefore, both overly exaggerated or overly calm descriptions need to be avoided.

You have some creative freedom when contributing to [One-Among.Us](https://one-among.us), but you should still follow some basic principles, such as:

1.  Be as close to the truth as possible.

2.  Cite the source for large paragraphs of quotations.

3.  Slangs in the community might be used for simplicity, but do add a comment when they first appear.

4.  The article should be written in third person.
    Please use proper gender pronouns in accordance with the wishes of them.

    For non-binary, agender or gender-non-confirming people,
    use gender-neutral language.
    If they did not declare their pronouns,
    you can use your [Gender-Neutral writing](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/legis-redact/legistics/p1p15.html) skills to avoid using pronouns.
    Otherwise,
    please use “they” in English and「ta」in Chinese for there is no proper, common Chinese characters at present.

5.  Use proper punctuations.
    In Chinese articles, regardless of language variant, use「」(outer) and『』(inner) for quotation marks in place of “” or ‘’ unless the words in the quotation marks are not Chinese.
    Use curly quotation marks instead of straight ones.

6.  If someone left us through suicide, please avoid mentioning the details of their methods to protect our readers.

    For example, you must not write down the name or dose of the substance involved.

## Contributing with GitHub

Before proceeding, please confirm that you have knowledge of:
- basics of `git`: cloning repositories, making commits, rebasing a branch (to the main branch), and syncing between upstream and local repositories;
- basics of GitHub: forking repositories, creating pull requests, and other major GitHub features for collaboration;
- basic grammar of the [YAML language](https://yaml.org/): indentation rules, usage of dash, spaces, and quotes, and escaping from special characters;
- basic grammar of the [Markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

Otherwise, you can simply email your writings or advices to [info@one-among.us](mailto:info@one-among.us).
Our staff will transform them properly.
We do not believe our contributors must master any technical skills – you can work in a more “traditional” way if you like and your contributions would still be valued.
